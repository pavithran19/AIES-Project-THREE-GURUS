# Vehicle color detection from main entrance gate video channel
## Description

This project implements vehicle color detection based on video captured from main gate entrance security. The goal is to detect the dominant color of the vehicle passing through the gate in the video stream.

## Task
- Use computer vision techniques to detect vehicles in the video frame.
- Area of ​​effect . deduction (ROI). ). ). ). . File:
```
git clone https://github.com/pavithran19/AIES-Project-THREE-GURUS.git
```
 Install required dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy
````
## Usage
1. Enter the recorded security key gate data as program input.
2. Run the program to process the video stream and detect the color of the vehicle.
3. Please see the output showing the original video stream with the detected vehicles and the corresponding colors highlighted

## Contributions
Contributions to improve this project are welcome. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- Implement various color detection algorithms.
- Improve vehicle detection methods to be more accurate.
- Add support for real-time processing - the authenticity of video streams.
- Provides updates. or text corrections. . . Error.
